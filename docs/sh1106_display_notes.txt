How does the SH1106 Display Images

- The SH1106 OLED I bought is 128x64, (128 wide, 64 len)

[] The SH1106 arranges its memory as an array of pages...

[] Each page consists of 8 rows of pixels, so the OLED is updated a page at a time
	Pg 0 -> Rows 0-7
	Pg 1 -> Rows 8-15
	Pg 2 -> Rows 16-23
	Pg 3 -> Rows 24-31
	...
	Pg 7 -> Rows 56-63
	
	A byte in memory controls 8 pixels...
	
[] Visualization?
	Imagine the memory region was set to all 0x00 (OFF) and this was sent to the OLED. It would be off.
	Now imagine for Pg 0, all the bytes were set to 0xFF (ON), and the updated buffer was sent to the OLED
	It would display a solid white line at the top...what does this mean to me?
	
[] A single byte controls a vertical line on the SH1106
	ex) setting pg 0 row 0 to 0x00 will turn off all the pixels in a single vertical slice on that page
		if everything else was set to 0xFF, then it would be small black line in the top left corner?

[] Each row contains 128 columns of a byte...
	ex) setting row 4-5 OFF in page 0. Write b1110 0111 = 0xD7 to all 128 columns in pg 0
